Project for Starter Hacks:

Using AWS lambda and the Amazon Developer Console we used Amazon Echo to tackle the problem of mental health. Used voice commands to create an assistant that anyone can talk to. Alexa would look for key words that a user said in a phrase to try and understand what the user was feeling. We used psycology papers to determine good strategies for Alexa to make a user feel comfortable and better than when they started their conversation. 

Future plans are to implement more situations that Alexa can understand, add tone of voice recognition to our platform and implement a neural net so Alexa could get better at determining a users mood.
