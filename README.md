## About Project:

This project was created in 24 hours for Starter Hacks 2019. Using AWS lambda and the Amazon Developer Console we used Amazon Echo to use technology to improve accessibility to mental health services. We created an assistant that anyone can talk to, using voice commands. 

Alexa searched for key words that a user said in a phrase. This was done as an attempt to understand what the user was feeling. We used psycology papers to determine good strategies for Alexa to make a user feel comfortable and better than when they started their conversation. 

This project served as a proof of concept to ensure Alexa could be used to improve someones day. The scenario implemented during the Hackathon was a break up. Future applications would be to use a AWS dynamo DB database to store attributes about the user and track their mental health over time. Moreover, using natural language processing to better understand tone. 

## Usage
The code in this repository was written in ```Python 3.7``` for use in AWS lambda. Upload this file either as a ```ZIP``` or copy and paste into the console. After the lambda function has been created ensure the invoke link is present in the Alexa Developer Console.
